# CIS Compliance Framework

## Overview
This repository documents a pragmatic approach to CIS compliance that
balances security controls with platform reliability and operability.

Compliance is treated as an ongoing process involving assessment,
enforcement, validation, and risk acceptance.

## Scope
- CIS Linux Benchmark alignment
- CIS Kubernetes Benchmark alignment
- Compliance assessment and gap analysis
- Mapping of controls to automation
- Exception handling and risk acceptance

## Non-Goals
- Blind enforcement of all CIS controls
- One-time compliance exercises
- Tool-specific compliance dashboards

## Relationship to Other Repositories
- Enforcement automation is implemented in `config-management-ansible`
- Platform security principles are defined in `sre-platform-lab`
- Incidents and security events feed back into compliance improvements
